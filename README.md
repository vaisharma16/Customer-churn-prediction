# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN | Keras and Tensorflow | Deep Learning Classification

## Introduction to Customer Churn: The concept of customer churn refers to losing customers or clients. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

**Project Overview**: This project demonstrates how to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Keras and TensorFlow to predict customer churn. The dataset used includes various customer attributes like tenure, services subscribed, contract type, and monthly charges.

**Data Preprocessing**: This project emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling to ensure the model performs accurately.

**Building the ANN Model**: The ANN structure starts with input, hidden, and output layers. To initialize the model, add layers, and use activation functions like ReLU for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer.

**Compiling and Training the Model**: The model is compiled using the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. It shows the training process, highlighting the significance of choosing the right number of epochs and batch size.

**Evaluating Model Performance**: This project demonstrates how to evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

**Conclusion**: This project wraps up by stressing the importance of model evaluation and fine-tuning to improve prediction accuracy and effectively prevent customer churn.
